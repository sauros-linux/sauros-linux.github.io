          <h1>about saurOS</h1>
          <h2>what even is saurOS?</h2>
          <p>
            saurOS was a project I did for a class in college. Effectively, it was (and still is) just a modified archiso with some nice little bits and bobs.
          </p>

          <h2>why bulbasaur?</h2>
          <p>I like him.</p>

          <h2>can i do <strong>X</strong> with this?</h2>
          <p>
            Do whatever you want except for sell it.
            As a note, I do not own any of the pieces of artwork in the distribution nor do I own the copyright of Bulbasaur.
            I may wish I did, but that is not the world we live in.
            Keep that in mind if you want to do anything with this project.
          </p>

          <h2>why maintain this if it was a college project?</h2>
          <p>
            Well, for one it's funny. I'm not taking this seriously, and if anyone actually does then I'll be shocked.
            If I do update this, the extent would just be adding more Bulbasaur art and updating the mirrors.
            I likely won't be accepting pull requests, this is just my stupid little project and I don't intend on ever taking this seriously.
          </p>

          <h2>can i maintain it?</h2>
          <p>
            Why? This is my dumb joke, you can go get your own.
